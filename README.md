equirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a foundation for understanding and applying Requirement Analysis — a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
Its purpose is to document, analyze, and structure project requirements for a Booking Management System, demonstrating how clear, well-defined requirements set the stage for successful software design and implementation.
Through this project, you’ll explore real-world techniques for identifying functional and non-functional requirements, creating visual diagrams, and defining precise acceptance criteria to align technical goals with user needs.
